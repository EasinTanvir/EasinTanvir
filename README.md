### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am EasinTanvir
#### Full Stack Developer

I've building website for more than two years. As a developer I grow up with some backend technologies but after that I became more and more frontend developer using modern frameworks like React. I am experienced in so many fron-end languages like React, Javascript, TypeScript, NextJs, Html, Css, Sass, Bootstrap, MaterialUi and also familiar with backend technologies like nodeJs and expressJs as well. I am highly experienced at building RestfulApi, and advance React features like Virtual DOM, Performance, Extensions, Creating Refs Code-Splitting, and for global state management I am adept with Redux as well as contextApi. As all we know A server-side rendered application speeds up page loading and improves user experience and The web apps built using ReactJS are slow as compared to NextJS. So I am here to give you the best user experience using all the core features of NextJs like Image Optimization, Hybrid: SSG and SSR, Incremental Static Regeneration,Fast Refresh and others.

Skills: JavaScript / React /NodeJs /ExpressJs/ NextJs/HTML5 / CSS3/Bootstrap5
